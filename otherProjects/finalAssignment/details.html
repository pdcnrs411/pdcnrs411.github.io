           <p><strong>Disc Drive Errors: </strong>  if none of your discs will play, or if you insert a disc and your console doesn't recognize it we can help diagnose and fix the issue</p>
              <p><strong>Red Ring of Death: </strong>  the RRoD is a sign displayed by the 360's "Ring of Light" when there is a general hardware failure. While this can be caused by any part (or lack thereof) of the 360, the general cause is most often excessive heat, which stresses the solder joints on the CPU and GPU. Over time, these joints can become separated, which causes the Red Ring to appear after a few years of use</p>
              <p><strong>Numerous Other Repairs: </strong> Our team has the skills and expertise to diagnose and fix countless console issues, give us a call with your issue and we'll let you know if we can help.</p>
