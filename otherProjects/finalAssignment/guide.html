        <p><strong>Auto-Save: </strong> Something you know you shouldnâ€™t switch your PC off during, but occasionally feel the urge to just to stick one to that smug spinning icon.<p>

        <p><strong>Avatar: </strong> A player character, usually customisable. Come in many flavours, occasionally including tall and blue, but none worse than that M. Night Shyamalan movie.</p>

        <p><strong>Closed-Beta: </strong> Closed beta: A brief period of time where developers give a game to fans to test, and then pretend that all of their problems and complaints will actually be fixed before release.</p>

        <p><strong>Free To Play: </strong>A delightful sweep of games, their goals ranging from simply getting lots of players in and hoping some pay up, to pay mechanics so hostile that they might as well swear at you every time you put in your credit card number.</p>

        <p><strong>MOBA: </strong>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. A magic incantation guaranteed to summon hordes of angry MOBA players demanding you not call them MOBAs. </p>

        <p><strong>SLI: </strong>Scalable Link Interface. An NVIDIA technology for combining the power of two graphics cards. Finally at the point where it no longer feels like punishment for being tight-fisted.</p>

<h3 class="aboutSubHeading">Arcade Machines: </h3>
 <div class="aboutInfo bodyText col-sm-12 col-md-11">

        <p>An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers.

While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles increased in capability and decreased in cost.</p>

     <h3 class="aboutSubHeading">Super Nintendo vs Sega Genesis: </h3>
    <div class="aboutInfo bodyText col-sm-12 col-md-11">
        <p>Had SEGA not abandoned the contest so eagerly to pursue the Saturn's early release, perhaps the war would have ended on a different note. SEGA definitely had many things going for it in the beginning, like a laser-focused marketing campaign, good price point, and a strong generational difference. But Nintendo pushed ahead with a plan to squeeze as much value out of its single machine for the entirety of the generation, delivering great updates to its franchises and releasing cartridges like Star Fox and Donkey Kong Country that produced games you would not expect on a 16-bit machine without need of any upgrade or add-on. And with its continued success in its home territory of Japan despite the strong performance of the PC Engine, the Super NES claimed its place at the top of the generation.</p>
